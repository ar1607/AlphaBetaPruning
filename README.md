# Determining the minimax value for given positions of the Reversi game using Alpha-Beta Pruning.
## CSCI 561: Foundations of Artificial Intelligence
### Homework #1

In this project, you will write a program to determine the minimax value for given positions of the Reversi game, using the Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm with positional weight evaluation functions. The rules of the Reversi game can be found at  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi  and interactive examples can be found at  http://www.samsoft.org.uk/reversi/ .
